      <description>IMPORTANT We jump into coding so we can learn, BUT we don&amp;rsquo;t know what we already have from the language, from the library, and we don&amp;rsquo;t know what other libraries are available.&#xA;It is wise once past a cetain level of understanding to STOP, and take a look around.&#xA;We should evaluate anything that is already in the game. What can be replaced by what is offered? What is reusable for later projects?</description>

      <title>Our First Pygame - Fix wrap, bite me - part 10</title>

      <description>Fixing screen wrap To make the screen work I needed to sit down and sletch and talk through my logic. I needed to keep track of the movement in the tail in the same way I kept track in the head.&#xA;I placed these in gameobject before the init (mostly last_start_move_pos,last_direction,last_boundary_check), some of the rest are from the player.&#xA;start_move_pos = (0,0)&#xD;end_move_pos = (0,0)&#xD;direction = (0,0)&#xD;min = (0,0)&#xD;max = (0,0)&#xD;boundary_check = &amp;#34;none&amp;#34;&#xD;last_end_move_pos = (0,0)&#xD;last_start_move_pos = (0,0)&#xD;last_direction = (0,0)&#xD;last_boundary_check = &amp;#34;none&amp;#34; and we change setup next move to look like this (same fields again)</description>

      <description>Get some things out the way The file is starting to get too big. Lets move out some of the &amp;lsquo;helper&amp;rsquo; functions into thier own file.&#xA;Lets create another file and name it mygame_library.py and place the following in it&#xA;import pygame&#xD;from pygame.locals import *&#xD;# time based movement requires delta time&#xD;class DeltaTime():&#xD;def __init__(self):&#xD;self.last_loop = pygame.time.get_ticks()&#xD;self.dt = 0&#xD;def loop_time(self) -&amp;gt; int:&#xD;time_now_ms = pygame.time.get_ticks()&#xD;dt = time_now_ms - self.</description>

      <description>Decisions about the Code The direction is normalized. Well in this case -1 or 0 or 1. It cannot contain distance as we use directions in calculations that expect only 0 and +/- 1.&#xA;The end move position is calculated outside the class in the game loop, and the result is currently passed to the head. To move this code we need to store the tile size in the base class, everything else already belongs to the base class.</description>

      <description>What we have so far Make the tail follow We have a head with a face that can eat food but leaves droppings at each place it has eaten at. Lets address that.&#xA;What do we want to do?&#xA;make the tail follow the head tail can be added at head or at last tail piece (changes logic and appearance of the game only very slightly) reuse the code from the player for the tail wherever possible prevent messy code fix the class names to be consitant with the standard i.</description>

      <title>Our first pygame - continuous movement - part 6</title>

      <description>continuous movement The game Worm should have the worm moving even when you don&amp;rsquo;t have any keys pressed, unless the game has paused.&#xA;I continue using one tial at a time movement. It may be simpler to simply move in a direction, and only track the tile change when a turn is requested or when the end of the screen is reached.&#xA;So we will make a small change to allow the worm to keep moving in its last direction selected.</description>

      <description>Quick refactor before starting I mentioned in the last post we should do something with speed. Its used as a global inside the input class and I don&amp;rsquo;t like that. The original idea is to pass it in, but that wont work well because it is going to be used with delta time.&#xA;So here is a better idea. We will remove it.&#xA;replace speed inside our input class with 1 remove speed from being initialized before its needed Now we replace a small bit of code:</description>

      <description>Input is not smart enough We are going to add a key queue so we can keep track of the order of keys ben pressed or in our case the order of the keys currently held down.&#xA;We also want to move more of the input logic out the game and into the input class.&#xA;we add self.key_queue = [] to init then we change each keydown part something like this</description>

      <description>Refactor Letâ€™s move the keypress code into its own class.&#xA;class keyisdown():&#xD;def __init__(self) -&amp;gt; None:&#xD;self.leftkey = False&#xD;self.rightkey = False&#xD;self.upkey = False&#xD;self.downkey = False&#xD;def getEvents(self):&#xD;for event in pygame.event.get():&#xD;if event.type == QUIT:&#xD;return False&#xD;if event.type==pygame.KEYDOWN:&#xD;if event.key == K_ESCAPE:&#xD;return False&#xD;if event.key in [K_s, K_DOWN]:&#xD;self.downkey = True&#xD;if event.key in [K_w, K_UP]:&#xD;self.upkey = True&#xD;if event.key in [K_d, K_RIGHT]:&#xD;self.rightkey = True&#xD;if event.</description>

      <description>Now we get to play a little. Lets simply draw a simple background and then download some premade shapes that we can move around.&#xA;First head over to kenney.nl and get the following images to follow along. The files we want are in the png/default folder. The larger images are 80x80. If you are adventurous try other images.&#xA;I&amp;rsquo;m going to use individual 2d png files for each item to start.</description>

      <description>Some coding required For the first 10 posts of this series we don&amp;rsquo;t cover detail as most of this is common to the other tutorials out there. The exceptions being the screen wrap and the delta movement, which are explained to some degree. The delta movement is common to game programming in general, the screen wrap has different implementations.&#xA;Everything gets re-evaluated in each new game we build with the resulting libraries of reuseable code.</description>
